2018 HackFRee district-wide hackathon project

Description:
	- OCR app for converting hand writing to text using a camera
	- Custom OCR model trained on modified versions of MNIST and EMNIST --> abandoned, accuracy on real-world images too low
	- Tessaract OCR module --> pre-trained OCR model (part of openCV). Allowed for better accuracy
	- Firebase was used to send image to computer for processing, and send response back to phone
